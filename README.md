=========

Collecting and presenting system data

This project contains two applications:
 - Java console application DataGenerator that collects CPU and network utilization data generated on interval provided by user and saves it to a mySQL DB.
 - Grails/Groovy web application that displays graph of the data collected with a choice of intervals (per min, per hour, per day).
   Below the graph application shows the table with all of the data
   
note: see Grails-Java-Sql-Homework.pdf for detailed info
