1) checked out the ways to collect the data on CPU usage, network utilisation, etc... Various reviews directed me to SIGAR product which was claimed to offer the best results. http://www.hyperic.com/support/docs/sigar/overview-summary.html
2) Went to https://support.hyperic.com/display/SIGAR/Home and checked out product documentation and then to http://sourceforge.net/projects/sigar/files/ from where I downloaded the product.
3) Started an Eclipse Java 1.7 project DataGenerator and added SIGAR .jar file to a build path.
4) Created a class CPUutil under the project.
5) Used CpuPerc SIGAR class and it's methods to get CPU utilization data (percentage)
6) Created NETutil class under the same project.
7) Used NetStat SIGAR class and it's methods to get network utilization data
8) Installed mySQL and created datagenerator mySQL database with cpudata and netdata tables
9) Added mySQL .jar file to a build path.
10) Created DataGenerator class with Tick extends TimerTask subclass which triggers CPUutil's and NETutil's methods and provides results for DBSave method which inserts this data to datagenerator database.
11) Main method triggers TimerTask method each minute.

***later added***

12) Added possibility to choose time interval
13) replaced timer with executor
14) Changed error handling
